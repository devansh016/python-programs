A standard science experiment is to drop a ball and see how high it bounces.Once the “bounciness” of the ball has been determined, the ratio gives a bouncinessindex. For example, if a ball dropped from a height of 10 feet bounces 6 feethigh, the index is 0.6, and the total distance travelled by the ball is 16 feet afterone bounce. If the ball were to continue bouncing, the distance after two bounceswould be 10 ft+ 6 ft+ 6 ft+ 3.6 ft = 25.6 ft. Note that the distance travelled foreach successive bounce is the distance to the floor plus 0.6 of that distance as theball comes back up. Write a program that lets the user enter the initial heightfrom which the ball is dropped and the number of times the ball is allowed tocontinue bouncing. Output should be the total distance travelled by the ball."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"3cYUPakNw1sS","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1631178686103,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":4152,"user":{"displayName":"DEVANSH CHAUDHARY 201461","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14Gherdw-dWtgOSR7WSleRbbTlprIjvsjPEBCuu3M5g=s64","userId":"10596455907384479960"}},"outputId":"db305d35-aa4c-4092-8fbf-b1788143065b"},"source":["height = int(input('Enter initial height of ball: '))\n","no_of_bounces = int(input('Enter the number of time ball will bounce: '))\n","\n","total_distance = 0\n","\n","while(no_of_bounces!=0):\n","  total_distance += height + height*0.6\n","  height *=0.6\n","  no_of_bounces -=1\n","\n","print(total_distance)"],"execution_count":30,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Enter initial height of ball: 10\n","Enter the number of time ball will bounce: 1\n","16.0\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"PP0bJ51o06MA"},"source":["Q4. A local biologist needs a program to predict population growth. The inputs would be the initial number of organisms, the rate of growth (a real number greater than 0), the number of hours it takes to achieve this rate, and a number of hours during which the population grows. For example, one might start with apopulation of 500 organisms, a growth rate of 2, and a growth period to achievethis rate of 6 hours. Assuming that none of the organisms die, this would implythat this population would double in size every 6 hours. Thus, after allowing 6 hours for growth, we would have 1000 organisms, and after 12 hours, we wouldhave 2000 organisms. Write a program that takes these inputs and displays a prediction of the total population."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"yL_wcBnq1GU-","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1631179157539,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":10766,"user":{"displayName":"DEVANSH CHAUDHARY 201461","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14Gherdw-dWtgOSR7WSleRbbTlprIjvsjPEBCuu3M5g=s64","userId":"10596455907384479960"}},"outputId":"75441b61-9745-4d92-c870-76ea884762cc"},"source":["organisms = int(input('Enter initial number of organisms: '))\n","rate = int(input('Enter rate of growth of organisms: '))\n","rate_time = int(input('Enter the number of hours it take to achieve this rate: '))\n","total_time = int(input('Enter the numbers of hours during which population grows: : '))\n","\n","print('\\nPredicted population: ',int(organisms * rate * total_time/rate_time));"],"execution_count":33,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Enter initial number of organisms: 500\n","Enter rate of growth of organisms: 2\n","Enter the number of hours it take to achieve this rate: 6\n","Enter the numbers of hours during which population grows: : 12\n","\n","Predicted population:  2000\n"]}]}]}
